# FUME - FHIR Utilized Mapping Engine

FUME is a sophisticated FHIR convertion tool.

The engine has the following main parts:

 * A FUME mapping language interpreter, based on a fusion between JSONata and FHIR Shorthand. See here: [https://www.fume.health/docs/flash](https://www.fume.health/docs/flash)
 * Connection to a FHIR server that enables it to be used as a repository for saved FUME mappings & translation tables
 * FHIR-oriented functions that assist in the transformation to or from FHIR resources
 * RESTful API to run the transformation against a JSON, CSV or HL7 V2 input

You are welcome to play with the mapping language in our inteactive public sandbox at [https://try.fume.health](https://try.fume.health).
 
Installation & deployment instructions can be found at our [getting started](docs/getting-started.md) page.
